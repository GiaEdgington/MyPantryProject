## My Pantry

Forget what groceries you have at home, or just simply run out of ideas for what to cook with them? This app allows users to track their digital inventory of groceries and access recipes leveraging ingredients they already have. 

## How It's Built

- Wrote back-end functionality using Ruby on Rails and the MVC pattern.

- Used Spoonacular API to deliver recipes requested based on ingredients available.

- Developed front-end writing custom HTML and vanilla Javascript to create user interface.

- Created custom CSS to style app with pantry theme.
