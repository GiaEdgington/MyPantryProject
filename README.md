## My Pantry
This app allows users to track their digital inventory of groceries and access recipes leveraging ingredients they already have. 

## How It's Built

- Wrote back-end functionality using Ruby on Rails and the MVC pattern.

- Used Spoonacular API to deliver recipes requested based on ingredients available.

- Developed front-end writing custom HTML and vanilla Javascript to create user interface.

- Created custom CSS to style app with pantry theme.
